    <h4>Object</h4>
    <p>To open a object you simply enter pair of curly braces for example const book {}; or you may possibley create an object using a constructor function for example const book = new Object(); however most preffered is the first example which use curly braces.</p>
    <p>Accessing properties you can use a dot to access the properties of an object. for example book.page</p>


    <h2>DOM</h2>
    <P>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming <br>
       interface for web documents. It represents the page so <br>
        that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. <br>
        The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, <br>
       programming languages can interact with the page.</P>
       <P>The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).  <br>In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects. </P>
      <h4>JavaScript HTML DOM Elements</h4>
       <p>Finding HTML elements by id <br>
        Finding HTML elements by tag name <br>
        Finding HTML elements by class name <br>
        Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors <br>
        Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections</p>


        <h4>Events</h4>
        <p>Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you <br>
           are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react <br>
             to them.

          For example, if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to react to that action by displaying an information box</p>

          <h4>Other example of Events </h4>
          <p>
            onchange	An HTML element has been changed <br>
            onclick	The user clicks an HTML element <br>
            onmouseover	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element <br>
            onmouseout	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element <br>
            onkeydown	The user pushes a keyboard key <br>
            onload	The browser has finished loading the page <br>
          </p>

    <script >
//         let user = {
//   name: "John",
//   age: 30
// };

// user.sayHi = function() {
//   alert("Hello!");
// };

// user.sayHi(); // Hello!


// method shorthand looks better, right?
// user = {
//   sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
//     alert("Hello");
//   }
// };

// let user = {
//   name: "John",
//   age: 30,

//   sayHi() {
//     // "this" is the "current object"
//     alert(this.age);
//   }

// };

// user.sayHi(); // John
