    <h1>Notes </h1>
    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p>Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had entered all the necessary data and then <br>
        pressed the Submit button. If the data entered by a client was incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have <br>
         to send all the data back to the client and request that the form be resubmitted with correct information. This was really a <br>
         lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden on the server.

    </p>

    <p>JavaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server. <br>
         Form validation generally performs two functions.

    </p>

    <p>Basic Validation First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. It would require  <br>
         just a loop through each field in the form and check for data.</p>

         <p>Data Format Validation âˆ’ Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. Your code must include <br>
             appropriate logic to test correctness of data.</p>

            <h4>OOP</h4>
            <p>JavaScript is a very good language to write object oriented web apps. It can support OOP because supports inheritance through <br>
                 prototyping also properties and methods. You can have polymorphism, encapsulation and many sub-classing paradigms.
            </p>
    <form name='search' action='/search'>
        <input name='searchInput'>
        <button type='submit'>Search</button>
        </form>
    </main>
        <script>
            const form = document.forms.search;
             const input = form.elements.searchInput;
input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'),
 false);

//  input.addEventListener('blur', () => alert('blurred'),
//  false);
//  input.addEventListener('change', () => alert('changed'),
//  false);
// const form = document.forms['search'];
form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false);
function search() {
alert(' Form Submitted');
event.preventDefault();
}

function search(event) {
alert(`You Searched for: ${input.value}`);
event.preventDefault();
}




// function search(event) {
// alert('Form Submitted');
